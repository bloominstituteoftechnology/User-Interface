# Assessing Your User Interface and Git Learning

* The objective of this challenge is test your knowledge on all of the topics surrounding user interface and git you learned this week.

You can _reference_ any old code you may have and the training kit content, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.

#### Pro tip: Commit every time you have completed a task or feature!

## Task 2: Comprehension Questions
